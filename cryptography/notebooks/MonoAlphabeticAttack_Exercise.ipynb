    "\n",
    "In this exercice you will implement an attack to the mono alphabetic cipher using the corpus of the book Nineteen eighty four by George Orwell. Needless to say, a masterpiece worth reading for anyone intereted in privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob want to communicate secretly so they meet in person and choose a key that nobody else knows. They agree on using the mono alphabetic cipher to encrypt and decrypt their messages. An attacker (Charlie) is eavesdroping the communication betweeen Alice and Bob so he's able to see all the ciphertext they send to each other. Charlie only knows that Alice and Bob communicate in english and that they use the mono alphabetic cipher. Our question here is, can Charlie crack the secret key with just this information? We will see how in this exercice\n",

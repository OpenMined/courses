We define $\\pi$(x) as the number of prime numbers smaller than x. For instance, $\\pi$(20)=8, because prime numbers smaller than 20 are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19}. Therefore, to calculate the number of primes between $x_2$ and $x_1$ ($x_2$>$x_1$) we just need to subtract both $\\pi$($x_2$)-$\\pi$($x_1$). Here $\\pi$(x) is exact calculation and we have to do it numerically. The prime number theorem establishes the asymptotic distribution of prime numbers by approximating the count to x/ln(x)"

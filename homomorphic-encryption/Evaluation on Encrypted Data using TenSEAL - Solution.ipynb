    "We have previously discussed some intuitions on how to choose the encryption parameters, and now we have to put them into practice. Our model evaluation requires 3 multiplications, one for the square activation, and two for the matmul operation. So we ultimately need 3 `bits_scale` at the middle of our `coeff_mod_bit_sizes`. Now the choice of `bits_scale`, which impacts the precision of the fractional part, so we can try different values (so different precisions) so that we don't impact accuracy by much. The last coefficient modulus should be higher than the `bits_scale` and the difference between them (5 here) impacts the precision of the integer part. Since we are manipulating small numbers here, 5 should be enough. After choosing those parameters, we need to find the appropriate polynomial modulus degree to use, to guarantee 128-bits security. You can start with small power of two (e.g. 4096) and go higher, till TenSEAL doesn't throw an error. If you are more curious, you can look-up the bounds for those parameters and choose the right one directly. It is also important to choose the polynomial modulus degree that allows us to put all our elements into a ciphertext. Here, we need to put 1024 values, and anything above 2048 should make it, but only 8192 (and above) meet the security requirement."

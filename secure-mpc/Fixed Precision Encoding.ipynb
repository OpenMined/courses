    "### [Video] Introduction to FixedPrecision vs FloatPrecision\n",
    "Script:\n",
    "- This section is about fixed precision encoding. Fixed point precision encoding is the counterpart of floating point precision encoding. To better understand what is fixed point precision (or fixed precision in short) and why we use it, let’s start by understanding float precision, the most commonly used encoding.\n",
    "- In statistics, we often deal with real numbers, not integers! This is very helpful for math analysis, especially to be able to use concepts like differentiation that we use intensively during back-propagation when we train a neural network.\n",
    "- But computers are only made of zeros and ones! Therefore we need a way to represent all numbers in terms of 0 and 1, namely we need to find a proper encoding.\n",
    "- So first, we are always considering decimal numbers. If you think of $\\pi$, we can't use it directly, but only a decimal approximation, which might be sufficient for many computations.\n",
    "- The most common way to encode decimal numbers is to encode them on 32 bits, using the float precision encoding. The idea of floating precision is close to the notion of scientific notation : we store separately the most significant numbers (that we call the mantissa), and the exponent, that is a power of 10 (or a power of 2 in practice), and we multiply them together to reconstruct the original number. You can think of the exponent as the position of the point in the decimal notation.\n",
    "- Let's take an example, if I wanted to store 3.14, I would store separately the digits 314 and the position of the point.\n",
    "- It makes it very convenient to store with high fidelity very big and very small numbers: you only need to say that the exponent is very big or very small. This encoding is therefore widely used in practice.\n",
    "- However, when you compute the addition of two floating point numbers with different exponents, you need to convert them to adopt the same exponent, which can be complicated when those numbers are private as in secure multi-computation.\n",
    "- Therefore, we will use fixed precision, that we will explore more in depth just now!"

    "### Floating point and fixed point arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video above, we've been through the concept of floating point numbers. A schematic way of understanding this encoding is to compare it to the scientific notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example, like $123.456$. The scientific notation is $1.23456 \\times 10^2$, where $1.23456$ is stored on the mantissa and $2$ in the exponent. Depending on the size of the mantissa, we might need to drop the least significant digits and store for example $1.23 \\times 10^2$. In practice, we will use powers of $2$ in the float encoding, but for now we can stick to $10$ for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to add 2 numbers, $123.456$ and $7.3$, which are encoded in such a way that the mantissa only stores the 3 most significant digits, then we can write them $1.23 \\times 10^2$ and $7.3 \\times 10^0$. To be able to add them, we will rewrite the numbers to express them with the same exponent, usually the largest. In our example, we will hence rewrite the addition: $1.23 \\times 10^2 + 0.07 \\times 10^2$. Note that we have lost some precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more about floating point precision [here](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~eedwards/compsys/float/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapting the exponents can be costly when dealing with private numbers, where the mantissa and the exponent are not available in clear text. Therefore, in many implementations of secure multi-party computation, we use fixed point precision encoding, which as you might guess is actually much simpler!\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, it consists of taking a fixed public exponent for all the numbers involved in the computation. Therefore, we usually consider separately an integer value (for example a `LongTensor` if you're using PyTorch or a `np.int64` for Numpy users), and the fixed exponent. For example, we could set the precision to $10^{-6}$, and a number like $123.456$ would be encoded as $123456000 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes addition very easy because you don't have any rescaling to compute: you just have to sum the integers values and keep the exponent unchanged. One limitation however of fixed precision is that the range of values you can store is much more limited, you can’t store numbers smaller than $10^{-6}$ in the example above. In addition, the smaller the precision (like if you reduce from 6 to 2), the bigger the rounding error of your encoding. In practice, as we are doing classic statistics and machine learning, such encoding is good enough to achieve accuracies close to floating point precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one subtlety however, which has to do with multiplication. Let's consider for example the multiplication of $1.2$ and $2.0$ encoded with a decimal precision of 2, so $120 \\times 10^{-2}$ and $200 \\times 10^{-2}$. If we multiply the integer part, and keep one of the encodings, we end up with $24000 \\times 10^{-2}$ so $240$ instead of $2.4$. We can either increase the precision from 2 to 4, but in the fixed precision setting we really want the precision to remain constant, or we can truncate the integer part, by removing the 2 least significant digits which correspond to the current precision of 2: $(24000 // 10^2) \\times 10^{-2} = 240 \\times 10^{-2} = 2.4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have been considering the decimal precision, i.e with base 10, but in practice it's more suitable to use the bit precision, i.e with base 2, because the size of the mantissa is expressed in number of bits. $1.5$ encoded in a bit precision of 3 would be $12 \\times 2^{-3}$. We will use both in the rest of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok this was a lot of theory, let's practice now!"

    "##### A working public division\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider shares to be in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^{4}}$ to simplify the computation. $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^{4}}$ represents all the integers in the range $[-8, 7 ]$. Indeed, $2^{4} = 16$ and we consider signed numbers, so instead of the range $[0, 15]$, we use $[-8, 7]$. We will get back to this convention a bit later.\n",

    "Let's now consider $x = -4$, shared as such: $[x] = (x_{alice}, x_{bob}) = (6, 6)$. This sharing is correct since 6 + 6 = 12 which maps to 12 - 16 = -4 in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^{4}}$. We say that there is a _wrap around_, as we exceeded the maximum value of our space, 7. Dividing the shares by 2 like before would lead to a sharing (3, 3), which reconstructs to $6 \\neq -4/2$. It's failing!!\n",
    "\n",
    "So what happened? Actually the shared result (3, 3) is still valid, but no longer in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^{4}}$ but in the space of values divided by 2, namely $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^{3}}$. Indeed, $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^{3}}$ represents the range $[-4, 3]$, so 3 + 3 = 6 should map to 6 - 8 = -2 in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^{3}}$. However, we want to keep the same space for all the shares that we are using, so we need to find a workaround.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why it failed is because of the _wrap around_, which happens when we sum the shares of $x$ but not when we sum the shares of $x / 2$. It is not possible for any of the parties holding a single share of $x$ to know if there is a wrap around $\\theta_x$, because it would reveal information about the other parties shares. However, they can privately compute the wrap around and obtain a secret shared $[\\theta_x]$. Computing such $[\\theta_x]$ is non-trivial, and we will leave as a black box the function that computes it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having access to $[\\theta_x]$ helps to compute privately and correctly $x / k$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^{n}}$ using the following formula:\n",

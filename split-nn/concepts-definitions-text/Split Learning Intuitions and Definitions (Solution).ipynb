    "Split learning refers to the process of cutting a Deep Neural Network (DNN) into two or more sections and deploying the first section on-device (e.g. a client's smart-phone) and the second section on the server. In this setting, intermediate activations from the chosen cutting point layer (called split layer) of the DNN are communicated from the client to the server during training. The rest of the network is processed at the server during forward propagation. In turn, during backpropagation, the gradients from the server’s first layer (layer next to the split layer) are communicated back to the client. The rest of the backpropagation occurs at the client. These rounds of communication are continued to finish all the epochs of distributed training ([NoPeek](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09161.pdf) and [split-nn for health](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00564.pdf)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Federated learning and split learning share the same goal, which is to avoid sending raw user data to untrusted third parties. However, the method in which they approach this goal is different: federated learning does so by sending only the gradient updates to the server, whereas split learning achieves this by sending the intermediate activations from the split layer, which is an abstracted representation of the input. This is the most important difference between these two schemes, and we won't discuss more details in this session. If you are interested in more extensive comparisons, you can check out these resources: [FL Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04977) and [Efficieny Comparison](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09145.pdf)."

    "## How is Split Learning Enhancing Privacy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Vanilla split learning enhances privacy by sharing only the intermediate activations of the users' data. The intermediate activations are like \"smashed data\". They have gone through the first few layers of the DNN, and have been stripped of some information they initially had, so in most cases, they have less information than the actual raw input. However, the information lost through the network itself is not necessarily enough to provide any meaningful privacy. Researchers have shown it is possible to invert the intermediate activations and reconstruct the input images with high accuracy [model inversion attack](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3359789.3359824). For this reason, split learning is often accompanied by supplementary mechanisms to help mitigate privacy and degrade excessive information two of these mechanisms are [NoPeek](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09161.pdf) and [Shredder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11814).\n",
    "\n",
    "To re-iterate, we can say split learning, on its own, does not provide any rigorous worst-case privacy guarantees. The privacy enhancement brought by split neural networks and their variations is quantified using information-theoretic notions, and \"information degradation\". In the rest of this session, we will focus on what we mean by \"information-theoretic privacy\", and how it can be measured. "

    "Information-theoretic privacy is a context-aware privacy notion. Context-aware notions explicitly model the data statistics, unlike context-free solutions (like differential privacy) that assume worst-case dataset statistics and adversaries. In simple words, methods that rely on this privacy notion, show they are decreasing the information content of the user's sensitive data, and are in a sense, removing the sensitive private information. To better understand these methods, we will first go through some simple definitions in information theory, and then quantify what we mean by information."

    " *Entropy* quantifies how much information there is in a *single* random variable ([source](https://machinelearningmastery.com/information-gain-and-mutual-information/)). In other words, entropy is a measure of \"surprise\", \"uncertainty\", and \"unpredictability\". The more unpredictable the outcome of a process is, the higher is the entropy assigned to it.  As an example, consider a biased coin with probability p of landing on heads and probability $1-p$ of landing on tails. The maximum surprise is for $p = 1/2$ when there is no reason to expect one outcome over another, and in this case, a coin flip has an entropy of one bit. The minimum surprise is when $p = 0$ or $p = 1$, when the event is known and the entropy is zero bits ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory))). Other values of p give different entropies between zero and one bits. \n",

Intuitively, one might ask, how much does one random variable tell me about another? For example, suppose $X$ represents the roll of a fair 6-sided die, and $Y$ represents whether the roll is even (0 if even, 1 if odd). Clearly, the value of $Y$ tells us something about the value of $X$ and vice versa. That is, these variables share mutual information. On the other hand, if $X$ represents the roll of one fair die, and $Z$ represents the roll of another fair die, then $X$ and $Z$ share no mutual information. The roll of one die does not contain any information about the outcome of the other die ([7](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~elm/Teaching/Docs/mutInf.pdf)).

In the latter case, the probability of seeing heads is lower ($0.1$, vs $0.5$), so it is more surprising to see heads, and therefore, it conveys more bits of information ($1.0$ vs $3.2$). However, for the overall random variable, the fair case has $1.0$ bit entropy, but the unfair case has less than half. This makes sense since overall, there is less surprise when we know there is a $90\\%$ probability that we see tails, compared to when there is a $50\\%$ chance. In other words, the fair coin toss has the highest overall surprise, and therefore the higher entropy. This is also shown in Example 2 above. "
